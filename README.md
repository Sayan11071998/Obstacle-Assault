# ***🚀 Obstacle Assault 🎮***

Welcome to **Obstacle Assault**—because who doesn’t love the thrill of dodging rotating platforms and jumping through chaotic obstacle courses? In this game, you’ll test both your skill and reflexes as you navigate through a series of intricate (and sometimes infuriating) challenges.

### **🎮 Game Features**
- **🌀 Dynamic Obstacles:** Moving platforms? Check. Rotating hazards? Double check. All designed to make you question your life choices.
- **⚠️ Collision Mechanics:** Timing is everything! One wrong move, and you’ll be back to square one—literally.
- **💡 Advanced Gameplay:** Carefully designed levels that push your patience—I mean, reflexes—and strategic thinking to the limit.

### **🧠 What I Learned**
- **🎮 Game Design Principles:** Mastered the art of frustrating players with moving/rotating platforms and collision mechanics (you're welcome!).
- **👨‍💻 Advanced C++ Programming:** Implemented complex gameplay features with C++, making me a code ninja in the process.
- **🏗️ Level Design:** Crafted levels that will challenge even the most skilled players (or make them rage quit—no judgment).
- **🛠️ Blueprint Integration:** Explored Unreal Engine Blueprints and seamlessly hooked them up with C++—turns out, they get along pretty well!
- **🔍 Troubleshooting & Debugging:** Solved countless issues to make sure everything works smoothly (after way too many coffee-fueled nights).

### **🚀 What’s Next?**
This project has been an incredible learning journey filled with equal parts frustration and triumph. I’m excited to continue improving my skills, adding new obstacles, and hopefully making future players pull their hair out even more. 😅
